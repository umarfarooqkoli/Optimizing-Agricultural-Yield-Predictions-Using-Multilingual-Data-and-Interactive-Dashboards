    "## üìÑ Presentation Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Executive Summary\n",
    "The project aims to predict agricultural yield using multilingual datasets, including Urdu-encoded data. It combines traditional EDA with interactive dashboards and predictive modeling to support data-driven decision-making in agricultural planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Introduction\n",
    "The introduction outlines the motivation behind the project, emphasizing the importance of multilingual data accessibility and the role of interactive analytics in improving agricultural outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Data Collection & Wrangling\n",
    "Data was collected from CSV files containing both English and Urdu columns. Unicode escape encoding was applied to handle multilingual text. Pandas was used for cleaning, transforming, and structuring the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ EDA & Interactive Visual Analytics Methodology\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis was performed using seaborn and matplotlib. Interactive visualizations were created using Plotly and Dash to allow dynamic filtering and deeper insight into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Predictive Analysis Methodology\n",
    "Regression models were built using scikit-learn. The methodology includes feature selection, train-test split, and evaluation using R¬≤ and MAE metrics. Model performance was visualized and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ EDA Visualization Results\n",
    "Multiple visualizations were created to explore relationships between variables, detect outliers, and understand distributions. Each plot is accompanied by markdown summaries and screenshots of code and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ SQL Results\n",
    "SQL queries were executed using SQLite to perform grouped summaries, joins, and conditional filtering. Results were visualized and interpreted in the presentation slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Folium Map\n",
    "An interactive Folium map displays geospatial data of agricultural zones, with markers and choropleth layers representing yield levels. This enhances spatial analysis and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Dash Dashboard\n",
    "The dashboard includes dropdown filters, dynamic graphs, and real-time updates. It is designed for usability and clarity, with meaningful titles and layout enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Predictive Analysis Results\n",
    "Model results are presented with visual comparisons, performance metrics, and insights into feature importance. The predictive model supports actionable recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Conclusion\n",
    "The project successfully integrates multilingual data, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards. It demonstrates the potential of data science in agricultural planning and proposes future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Creativity & Innovation\n",
    "The presentation goes beyond the template with custom themes, bilingual annotations, and animated transitions. Innovative insights include a framework for scaling the model to other regions and languages.\n",
